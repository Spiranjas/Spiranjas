        "# Module 1 No Code/Low Code Assignment: Stock Price Prediction with LLM (Using Gemini in Colab)\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment explores how large language models (LLMs) can perform complex tasks that previously required coding. Instead of manually writing code, we will interact with Google's Gemini (Click on the Gemini icon on the top right corner) in Google Colab to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Load and analyze stock price data.\n",
        "- Engineer relevant features for prediction.\n",
        "- Build and evaluate models such as regression and random forest.\n",
        "- Discuss potential trading strategies based on predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: While this notebook contains example code, students are encouraged to use LLMs to generate code snippets and explanations, managing interactions within the LLM's context window.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task Breakdown\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Data Exploration\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Load historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2020-01-01 to 2023-01-01 using Yahoo Finance.\n",
        "- **Key Considerations**: Ensure the model retains context while summarizing key statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Feature Engineering\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Generate meaningful features such as moving averages, technical indicators, and volatility measures.\n",
        "- **Managing Context**: If the LLM forgets prior outputs, remind it by reintroducing key statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Model Building\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Train a model (regression for price prediction, random forest for trend classification).\n",
        "- **Split Ratio Consideration**: Explain the importance of train-test split (e.g., 70/30) and verify the LLM respects it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Model Evaluation & Prediction\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Use the trained model to predict stock prices for 2023-2024.\n",
        "- **Analyze Performance**: Interpret accuracy, RÂ² scores, and classification reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 5: Strategy Discussion\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Based on model performance, discuss possible trading strategies.\n",
        "- **Critical Thinking**: Evaluate whether the model is truly useful for financial decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the assignment, keep in mind that LLMs have a limited context window. If necessary, break down tasks into smaller chunks and reintroduce critical information.\n",

Improving Signal vs. Noise: Stock prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, including market sentiment and macroeconomic conditions, which technical indicators may partially capture.

Enhancing Predictive Power beyond Patterns: While technical analysis looks for historical patterns, fundamental and news-based analysis considers the intrinsic value and future prospects of the company.

        "# Potential Changes in Evaluation Metrics:\n",
        "# - Accuracy: Could potentially increase significantly if external features provide strong predictive signals that the technical features miss.\n",
        "# - Precision and Recall: Could improve, especially for predicting price increases (class 1), as positive news might lead to more confident and correct predictions of upward movement. Similarly, negative news might improve metrics for predicting no price increase (class 0) or downward trends (though the target is currently binary increase/no increase).\n",
        "# - Confusion Matrix: We would ideally see a decrease in False Positives and False Negatives, and an increase in True Positives and True Negatives, indicating fewer incorrect predictions.\n",
